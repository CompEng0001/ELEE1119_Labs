# Learning C

We will be doing this lab inconjuction with the C lecture. Key concepts will be explained and you will put into practice.

So let's make our first program.

To do this you will need to open up a terminal and ensure your system has `gcc` installed.

>> [https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-13/](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-13/)

Create a new directory and call it `ELEE1119/Learning_C` we can do this using the following commands in terminal. 

~~~admonish terminal

```
$  mkdir -p ELEE1119/Learning_C
```

~~~

~~~admonish warning

- the `$` symbol used in the above indicates that this is a command that should be entered into the terminal.
- these are shell commands written in `c`. 

~~~

Now you are to navigate to this directory using the following command and create your first file:

~~~admonish terminal

```
$  cd ELEE1119/Learning_C
$  touch helloworld.c
```

~~~

~~~admonish note

Each line should be entered in seperately 

~~~

If we use the command `ls` we can list the content of the directory and should see at a file named 'helloworld.c'

~~~admonish terminal

```
$ ls
```

~~~

~~~admonish output

```
helloworld.c
```

~~~

Now we are going to open up and edit the content of the file and write it out: 

~~~admonish terminal

```
$ vim helloworld.c
```

~~~

Enter the following: 

~~~admonish code

```c
#include <stdio.h> // we need this library to get access to the input and out put methods for printing to terminal

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World\n"); // lets say hello, where it all began...
    
    printf("Goodbye World\n"); // this seems fitting as the program will close after this.
    
    return 0; // returns 0 to the int of main() and terminate the program
}
```

~~~

~~~admonish tip

- To use `i` to enter **INSERT** mode

- Escape key to current mode into **COMMAND** mode

- `:wq` write and quit

~~~

~~~admonish example title='Explanation'

Some explanation about the above code:

- All code gets executed inside of `main()`, 

- For the program to terminate the `main()` has to have a returnable value, `int`, 

- The keyword at the end of the `main()` is `return`, this is will return the value preceeding it, 

- A `0` execute means no errors. 

- Similar to `C#` to use libraries `c` programs import with the `#include` keyword instead of `using`. 

- The included library is the standard input out header, `stdio.h`.  

- By including this header file we have access to the `printf()` function that enables us to return information to the terminal in string format.

~~~

Now we are going to compile the code so that we have an executable file that can be run from the terminal:

~~~admonish terminal

```
$ gcc helloworld -o helloworld.exe
```

~~~

~~~admonish info


- `gcc` is another shell command that is built in `c`, it's purpose is to compile `.c` files into executables using the the `gcc`.

- Using the option `-o` we specifiy the output path/to/file

- For more info -> [gcc](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html)

~~~

Now let's see the fruits of our labour, the file can be executed as follows:

~~~admonish output

```
$ ./helloworld.exe
Hello World
Goodbye World
```

~~~

Congratulations, you used the programming language of the gods!

## Input/Output functions

In C programming, `printf()` is one of the main output function. The function sends formatted output to the screen. For example, the code below is a modified version of the helloworld programme we wrote a moment ago. 

Create a new file `vim inputoutput.c` and reproduce the code below:

~~~admonish code

```c
#include <stdio.h>    
int main()
{ 
    // Displays the string inside quotations
    printf("C Programming");
    return 0;
}
```

~~~

Remeber to use the vim shortcuts from before to edit, write and quit.

Compile and run:

~~~admonish terminal

```
$ gcc inputoutput.c -o inputoutput.anything
$ ./inputoutput.anything
C Programming
```

~~~

----------

### Data Type: Printing Integer

Now we are going to modifiy the script again `$ vim inputoutput.c` to look like below:

~~~admonish code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int testInteger = 5;
    printf("Number = %d", testInteger);
    return 0;
}
```

~~~


Remeber to use the vim shortcuts from before to edit, write and quit.

Run the script again... 
```
$ ./inputoutput.anything
```

What happened? 

Well we need to recompile the code. 

~~~admonish output

```
$ gcc inputoutput.c -o inputoutput.anything
$ ./inputoutput.anything
Number = 5

```

We use `%d` format specifier to print `int` types. Here, the `%d` inside the quotations will be replaced by the value of `testInteger`.

~~~

### Data Types: Printing Float and Double

Open and modify the same file again to look like below:

~~~admonish code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    float number1 = 13.5;
    double number2 = 12.4;

    printf("number1 = %f\n", number1);
    printf("number2 = %lf", number2);
    return 0;
}
```

~~~

Compile the code again using format `gcc <filesource> -o <fileoutput>`... hint what did you do before?

Run it `./<fileoutput>`: 

~~~admonish output

```
$ ./inputoutput.anything 
number1 = 13.500000
number2 = 12.400000
```
~~~

To print float, we use `%f` format specifier. Similarly, we use `%lf` to print double values.


### Data Types: Printing Characters

Open and modify the same file again to look like below:

~~~admonish code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char chr = 'a';    
    printf("character = %c", chr);  
    return 0;
} 
```
~~~

Remember to compile and then run:

~~~admonish output
```
$ ./inputoutput.anything 
character = a

```

~~~

To print `char`, we use `%c` format specifier.


### User Input in C

In C programming, `scanf()` is one of the commonly used function to take input from the user. The `scanf()` function reads formatted input from the standard input such as keyboards.

Again we will modify the program to look like the code below:

~~~admonish code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int testInteger;
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &testInteger);  
    printf("Number = %d",testInteger);
    return 0;
}
```

~~~

Compile and run:

~~~admonish output

```
$ ./inputoutput.anything
Enter an integer: 4
Number = 4
```

~~~

Here, we have used `%d` format specifier inside the `scanf()` function to take `int` input from the user. When the user enters an integer, it is stored in the `testInteger` variable.

~~~admonish info

Notice, that we have used `&testInteger` inside `scanf()`. It is because `&testInteger` gets the address of `testInteger`, and the value entered by the user is stored in that address. We will cover addressing and pointers at a later date.

~~~

## Format Specifiers

Here is a table of possible format specifiers for input and output:

|Data Type|	Format Specifier|
|---|---|
|`int`	|`%d`|
|`char`	|`%c`|
|`float`	|`%f`|
|`double`	|`%lf`|
|`short int`	|`%hd`|
|`unsigned int`	|`%u`|
|`long int`	|`%li`|
|`long long int`	|`%lli`|
|`unsigned long int`	|`%lu`|
|`unsigned long long int`	|`%llu`|
|`signed char`	|`%c`|
|`unsigned char`	|`%c`|
|`long double`	|`%Lf`|

## Data Types

Create a new file with `nano` like this:

~~~admonish terminal

```
$ vim dataTypeSize.c
```

~~~

We are going to write a program that returns the size of each data type availabe in `c`.

~~~admonish code

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){

    printf("Data_Types\t\tStorage_Size \n");
    printf("char\t\t\t%d byte(s) \n", sizeof(char));
    printf("int\t\t\t%d byte(s) \n", sizeof(int));
    printf("double\t\t\t%d byte(s) \n", sizeof(double));
    printf("float\t\t\t%d byte(s) \n", sizeof(float));
    printf("unsigned char\t\t%ld byte(s) \n", sizeof(unsigned char));
    printf("long\t\t\t%d byte(s) \n", sizeof(long));
    printf("unsigned long\t\t%ld byte(s) \n", sizeof(unsigned long));
    printf("long double\t\t%ld byte(s) \n", sizeof(long double));

    return 0;
}

```

~~~

~~~admonish terminal

```
gcc dataTypeSize.c -o dataTypeSize
```

~~~

Now enter the following to see the data types and there available sizes in bytes: 

~~~admonish output
```
$ ./dataTypeSize

```c
Data_Types              Storage_Size 
char                    1 byte(s) 
int                     4 byte(s) 
double                  8 byte(s) 
float                   4 byte(s) 
unsigned char           1 byte(s) 
long                    8 byte(s) 
unsigned long           8 byte(s) 
long double             16 byte(s) 
```
