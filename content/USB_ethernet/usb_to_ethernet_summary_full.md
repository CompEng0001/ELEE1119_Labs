# Summary of USB-to-Ethernet Information

## Explanation for Using USB-to-Ethernet on BeagleBoard

USB-to-Ethernet adapters are commonly used on devices like the BeagleBoard for several reasons:

1. **Lack of Built-In Ethernet Ports**: Some BeagleBoard models do not come with multiple Ethernet ports, so USB-to-Ethernet adapters provide an easy way to add more network interfaces.

2. **Network Isolation and Redundancy**: Multiple network interfaces can be used for separating traffic, providing network redundancy, or connecting to different networks.

3. **Network Configuration Flexibility**: USB-to-Ethernet adapters allow easy reconfiguration of network settings, making it possible to connect to different networks without altering the device's core settings.

4. **Compatibility and Ease of Use**: Most USB-to-Ethernet adapters are plug-and-play and are automatically recognized by Linux systems running on the BeagleBoard.

5. **Low Power and Portability**: These adapters consume minimal power and maintain the portable nature of setups using the BeagleBoard.

## 1. `dmesg` Output

The `dmesg` log shows the initialization of USB drivers and the registration of the USB host controller:

```
$ dmesg | grep -i usb 
[    1.278785] usbcore: registered new interface driver smsc95xx
[   23.605881] usb0: HOST MAC 08:04:b4:96:9e:d0
[   23.610314] usb0: MAC 08:04:b4:96:9e:cf
[   23.623644] usb1: HOST MAC 08:04:b4:96:9e:d2
[   23.630941] usb1: MAC 08:04:b4:96:9e:d3

[   24.261769] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): usb0: link becomes ready
```

- **`smsc95xx`** driver is registered, indicating support for SMSC LAN95xx USB-to-Ethernet adapters. 
    - Source code can be found here [https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/net/usb/smsc95xx.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/net/usb/smsc95xx.c)
    - Add a flow for the code here: 

        ```

          |
          v
        [End]
        ```
- **Network interfaces `usb0` and `usb1`** are initialized with MAC addresses, showing USB networking is set up.
- **`usb0` interface** becomes ready, suggesting it has successfully connected to a network.

## 2. `lsmod | grep usb` Output

The `lsmod` output lists loaded kernel modules related to USB functionality:

```
usb_f_acm              16384  2
u_serial               20480  3 usb_f_acm
usb_f_ecm              20480  2
usb_f_mass_storage     53248  2
usb_f_rndis            32768  4
u_ether                20480  2 usb_f_ecm,usb_f_rndis
libcomposite           65536  18 usb_f_ecm,usb_f_acm,usb_f_mass_storage,usb_f_rndis
```

- **`usb_f_ecm`** and **`usb_f_rndis`** modules provide USB Ethernet functionality, supporting Ethernet Control Model (ECM) and Remote Network Driver Interface Specification (RNDIS) protocols.
- **`u_ether`** is a helper module for USB Ethernet, enabling network over USB.
- **`libcomposite`** is a composite USB framework, allowing multiple USB functions (including Ethernet) to be combined into a single device.

## 3. `lsusb` Output

The `lsusb` command output identified the USB root hub but did not directly show the USB-to-Ethernet adapter:

```
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

- The USB root hub (`ID 1d6b:0002`) is detected, but no additional USB-to-Ethernet adapters are listed.
- The adapter might not be detected, or it may require further troubleshooting to appear in the `lsusb` list.

## 4. `usb-devices` Output

Details from the `usb-devices` command showed the USB host controller but not the USB-to-Ethernet adapter:

```
T:  Bus=01 Lev=00 Prnt=00 Port=00 Cnt=00 Dev#=  1 Spd=480 MxCh= 1
D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=01 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1
P:  Vendor=1d6b ProdID=0002 Rev=04.19
S:  Manufacturer=Linux 4.19.94-ti-r42 musb-hcd
S:  Product=MUSB HDRC host driver
S:  SerialNumber=musb-hdrc.1
C:  #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=e0 MxPwr=0mA
I:  If#=0x0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=09(hub  ) Sub=00 Prot=00 Driver=hub
```

 - **Breakdown:**
    - `T`: Indicates the device is connected to Bus 01 at root level (Lev=00), and is the first device (Dev#=1), operating at a high speed (Spd=480 Mbps), which is typical for USB 2.0. The device is a hub (MxCh=1 means it has one port).
    - `D`: Shows the device supports USB version 2.00, is of class 09 (hub), subclass 00, protocol 01, and has a maximum packet size of 64 bytes for endpoint 0.
    - `P`: Vendor ID 1d6b is the Linux Foundation, Product ID 0002 identifies it as a USB 2.0 root - hub, and Rev=04.19 is the revision number.
    - `S`: String descriptors indicate the manufacturer as "Linux 4.19.94-ti-r42 musb-hcd," the product as "MUSB HDRC host driver," and a serial number of "musb-hdrc.1."
    - `C`: The configuration descriptor shows one interface (#Ifs=1), configuration number Cfg#=1, attributes Atr=e0 (self-powered, remote wakeup), and no power requirement (MxPwr=0mA).
    - `I`: Interface descriptor for interface 0 (If#=0x0), using alternate setting 0, with one endpoint (#EPs=1), class 09 (hub), subclass 00, protocol 00, and handled by the driver hub.

      >> - `D` = Device Descriptor
      >> - `P` = Product/Version Information
      >> - `S` = String Descriptors
      >> - `C` = Configuration Descriptor
      >> - `I` = Interface Descriptor



## Current Network Configuration on BeagleBoard

Based on the `ifconfig` output provided, here is the current network configuration on your BeagleBoard:

- **`eth0`**: The primary Ethernet interface, possibly the built-in Ethernet port. It's up but not currently transmitting or receiving packets.
- **`lo`**: The loopback interface used for internal communication, functioning normally with transmitted and received packets.
- **`usb0`**: A USB-to-Ethernet interface, active and assigned IP `192.168.7.2`, indicating active use or connectivity.
- **`usb1`**: Another USB-to-Ethernet interface, assigned IP `192.168.6.2`, but shows no traffic, suggesting it's not connected or active.

## Conclusion

The logs and outputs suggest that while USB networking modules are loaded and functional, the USB-to-Ethernet adapter may not be fully recognized or properly connected. The presence of the `smsc95xx` driver in `dmesg` and network interfaces `usb0` and `usb1` indicate partial setup. Further steps include ensuring the adapter is connected correctly and verifying driver compatibility.
