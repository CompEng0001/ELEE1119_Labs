# Introduction to Embedded C Programming

Embedded C is a specialized extension of the C programming language designed specifically for programming embedded systems. Unlike general-purpose applications, embedded systems require code that is highly efficient, hardware-specific, and often real-time capable. This guide will introduce you to the essentials of Embedded C programming, focusing on using **avr-gcc** to compile code for AVR microcontrollers, such as the ATmega328P.

## What is an Embedded System?

Embedded systems are constrained by memory, processing power, and sometimes strict timing requirements, making efficient code essential.

## Why Use Embedded C?

Embedded C provides the familiarity and flexibility of the C language while allowing low-level hardware manipulation. Key reasons for using Embedded C include:

- **Direct Hardware Access**: Embedded C enables direct interaction with hardware registers.
- **Portability**: Code written in Embedded C can often be ported to different microcontrollers with minimal changes.
- **Efficiency**: Compiled C code can run close to the hardware, providing fast, deterministic behavior.
- **Standardization**: Embedded C adheres to ISO C standards, ensuring code compatibility and industry acceptance.


## What are Registers?

A **register** is a small, high-speed storage location within a microcontroller, typically 8 or 16 bits wide. Each register has a specific function, such as controlling a port, configuring the microcontroller’s peripherals, or managing data. Registers are memory-mapped, meaning each register has a unique address that can be accessed directly through code.

### Why Use Registers?

1. **Direct Hardware Control**: Registers provide a direct way to control and interact with the microcontroller's hardware.
2. **High Speed**: Accessing and modifying registers is faster than higher-level abstractions, which is essential in real-time applications.
3. **Precise Configuration**: Registers enable fine-tuned control over peripherals and hardware settings, allowing for efficient power and performance management.

### Example: Data Direction Register (DDR)

For example, each GPIO port (like `PORTB`, `PORTC`) has an associated Data Direction Register (`DDR`), which controls whether each pin is an **input** or **output**. Setting a bit in the `DDR` makes the corresponding pin an output, while clearing a bit makes it an input.

```c
// Example for ATmega328P microcontroller
DDRB |= (1 << PB5);  // Set PB5 as an output (LED pin
```

Here, `DDRB` is the data direction register for `PORTB`. By setting the bit corresponding to `PB5` (Bit 5), we configure it as an output.

## What are Ports?

A port in microcontroller terms refers to a group of pins on the microcontroller that are used for input and output. For the ATmega328P, ports are identified as `PORTB`, `PORTC`, and `PORTD`. Each port has multiple pins (bits) that can be configured independently as inputs or outputs, allowing for communication with external devices (e.g., LEDs, buttons, sensors).

- **PORT Register**: Controls the output value of each pin. Setting a bit high (1) sets the pin high (voltage applied), and clearing it (0) sets it low (grounded).
  
- **PIN Register**: Reads the input state of each pin. If the pin is high, reading from this register will return 1; if low, it will return 0.

### Example: Configuring and Controlling a Port Pin

```c
DDRB |= (1 << PB5);  // Set PB5 as an output (LED connected to Pin 13 on Arduino)
PORTB |= (1 << PB5); // Set PB5 high (turn on LED)
PORTB &= ~(1 << PB5); // Set PB5 low (turn off LED)
```

In this example:

- `DDRB` configures `PB5` as an output.
- `PORTB` sets `PB5` to high, turning on the LED.
- `PORTB` clears `PB5`, turning off the LED


## Key registers and their Roles

Let’s take a closer look at some commonly used registers for controlling GPIO, timers, and communication interfaces:

- **Data Direction Register (DDR)**
   - **Purpose**: Configures each pin as an input or output.
   - **Example**: DDRB controls the data direction for PORTB.

- **PORT Register**
  - **Purpose**: Sets the output value of each pin (either high or low).
  - **Example**: PORTB |= (1 << PB0); sets pin PB0 to high.

- **PIN Register**
  - **Purpose**: Reads the current state of an input pin.
  - **Example**: if (PINB & (1 << PB0)) {...} checks if PB0 is high.

- **Peripheral Control Registers**
  - Each peripheral (**UART**, **SPI**, **ADC**, etc.) has its own set of control registers to configure and manage its operation. For example, `UCSR0B` in ATmega328P controls **UART** transmission and reception.

### Why Direct Register Manipulation is Important in Embedded Systems

- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Microcontrollers typically have limited resources. Accessing registers directly minimizes overhead and ensures efficient use of processing power and memory.

- **Precise Timing Control**: Certain applications (e.g., PWM, interrupts) require precise control over timing. Directly setting registers allows you to meet these timing requirements more accurately than using higher-level abstractions.

- **Reduced Abstraction Layer**: While high-level abstractions (such as those provided in libraries like Arduino) make programming easier, they add layers that slow down processing. Direct register access is essential when maximum efficiency is required, especially in real-time applications.

    ```C
    #include <avr/io.h>
    #include <util/delay.h>

    #define LED_PIN PB5  // Pin connected to the LED

    int main() {
        // Set the LED pin as output
        DDRB |= (1 << LED_PIN);  // DDRB controls data direction for PORTB

        while (1) {
            // Toggle the LED
            PORTB ^= (1 << LED_PIN);  // XOR operation to toggle LED
            _delay_ms(500);           // Delay of 500 milliseconds
        }
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**
    - `DDRB |= (1 << LED_PIN);`: Configures `PB5` (`PORTB` Pin 5) as an output pin.
    - `PORTB ^= (1 << LED_PIN);`: Toggles the state of the pin, effectively blinking the `LED`.
    - `_delay_ms(500);`: Adds a 500-millisecond delay between toggles, making the `LED` blink on and off at a 1-second interval.
